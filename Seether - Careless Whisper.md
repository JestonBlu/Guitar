Dm7             Gm7   Bb
I feel so unsure as I take your hand and lead you 
Am7                 Dm
To the dance floor; As the music dies
Gm7                     Bb
 Something in your eyes Calls to mind a silver screen
    Am7
And all it's sad goodbyes

[Chorus]
Dm7                           Gm7                     Am7
 I'm never gonna dance again, Guilty feet have got no rhythm,
Bb                              Am7
 Though it's easy to pretend, I know you're not a fool
Dm7
Should have known better than to cheat a friend
    Gm7                             Am7
And waste the chance that I've been given
Bb
 So I'm never gonna dance again
    Am7
The way I danced with you.  

[Verse 2]
Dm7               Gm7
Time can never mend
    Bb                Am7
The careless whispers of a good friend
Dm7
 To the heart and mind
Gm7
 Ignorance is kind
Bb
Thereâ€™s no comfort in the truth
Am7
Pain is all you'll find

Dm7                           Gm7                     Am7
 I'm never gonna dance again, Guilty feet have got no rhythm,
Bb                              Am7
 Though it's easy to pretend, I know you're not a fool
Dm7
Should have known better than to cheat a friend
    Gm7                              Am7
And waste the chance that I've been given
Bb
 So I'm never gonna dance again
    Am7
The way I danced with you.  

[Verse 3]
  Dm7
Tonight the music seems so loud
  Gm7
I wish that we could lose this crowd
Bb
Maybe it's better this way
     Am7
We'd hurt each other with the things we'd wanna say

   Dm7
We could have been so good together
   Gm7
We could have lived this dance forever
    Bb                         Am7
But now who's gonna dance with me?

Please stay

Dm7                           Gm7                     Am7
 I'm never gonna dance again, Guilty feet have got no rhythm,
Bb                              Am7
 Though it's easy to pretend, I know you're not a fool
Dm7
Should have known better than to cheat a friend
    Gm7                             Am7
And waste the chance that I've been given
Bb
 So I'm never gonna dance again
    Am7
The way I danced with you.  

Dm7             Gm7                     Bb   Am7
(Now that you're gone) Now that you're gone
Dm7               Gm7                              Bb
(Now that you're gone) Was what I did so wrong, so wrong
                Am7
That you had to leave me alone

Dm7 Gm7 Bb Am7
Dm7 Gm7 Bb Am7
