Slip inside the eye of your mind
          E7             F    G
Don't you know you might find
                  C      Am G
A better place to play
C             G           Am
You said that you'd never been
            E7                 F    G
But all the things that you've seen

Slowly fade away

So I start a revolution from my bed

'Cos you said the brains I had went to my head
F                 Fm              C
Step outside, the summertime's in bloom

Stand up beside the fireplace
    E7/G#
And take that look from off your face
Am             G             F         G
You ain't ever gonna burn my heart out

So Sally can wait, she knows it's too late
         G          C   Am G
as we're walking on by
    C    G       Am   E7
Her soul slides away,
               F             G
but don't look back in anger
            C   G   Am   E7   F   G   C   Am G
I heard you say

C              G               Am
Take me to the place where you go
      E7     F      G                C    Am G
Where nobody knows, if it's night or day
C                     G           Am
Please don't put your life in the hands
     E7            F     G                    C    Am G
