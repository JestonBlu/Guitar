# A Long December - Counting Crows

## Intro/Chorus
```
E   A   F#m   A    E    A    F#m
```
## Verse 1
```
A          E                  B           F#m
  A long December and there's reason to believe
      A                 E               A
Maybe this year will be better than the last
 F#m             A       E                   B
   I can't remember the last thing that you said as you were
F#m
leavin'
        E             A
Now the days go by so fast
         E               A         F#m
And it's one more day up in the canyons
         E              A          F#m
And it's one more night in Hollywood
       E                  A     F#m
If you think that I could be forgiven... I wish you would.
```
## Chorus
```
E            A    F#m            A
   Na, na-na, na. Na, na-na, na-na, na-na, na, na.
E            A    F#m
   Na, na-na, na. Yeah...
```

## Verse 2
```
 A              E            B
   The smell of hospitals in winter
        F#m                A            E
And the feeling that it's all a lot of oysters, but no
 A
pearls
F#m        A              E               B
   All at once you look across a crowded room
           F#m               E           A
To see the way that light attaches to a girl
         E               A         F#m
And it's one more day up in the canyons
         E                 A       F#m
And it's one more night in Hollywood
       E               A           F#m
If you think you might come to California... I think you should
```

## Verse 3
```
 A             E              B              F#m
   Drove up to Hillside Manor sometime after two a.m.
    A               E               A
And talked a little while about the year
F#m             A                E              B
   I guess the winter makes you laugh a little slower,
           F#m            E               A
Makes you talk a little lower about the things you could not
show her
                A    E                    B           F#m
And it's been a long December and there's reason to believe
      A                 E               A
Maybe this year will be better than the last
F#m           A               E               B
   I can't remember all the times I tried to tell my myself
   F#m               E               A
To hold on to these moments as they pass
         E               A         F#m
And it's one more day up in the canyons
         E              A          F#m
And it's one more night in Hollywood
     E                       A            F#m
It's been so long since I've seen the ocean... I guess I should
