# Elliott Smith - Between the Bars

```
Am7              F
Drink up, baby, stay up all night.
           C
With the things you could do,
     E7
You won't but you might.
       Am7
The potential you'll be,
       F
That you'll never see,
      C        E7         F
The promises you'll only make.
      Am7
Drink up with me now,
        F
And forget all about
       C
The pressure of days.
E7
Do what I say,
          Am7
And I'll make you okay,
      F
And drive them away
      C      E7            F
The images stuck in your head
```

```
F   G    
People you've been before
          F     G     Am     Am/F#
That you don't want around anymore—
      F         G        
That push and shove and won't bend to your will.
F                 Fm
  I’ll keep them still.
```

```
 Am7               F
Drink up, baby, look at the stars.
      C
I'll kiss you again
E7
Between the bars,
            Am7
Where I'm seeing you there,
            F
With your hands in the air,
C            E7         F
Waiting to finally be caught.
      Am7
Drink up one more time,
     F
And I'll make you mine.
C
Keep you apart,
E7
Deep in my heart,
      Am7
Separate from the rest,
         F
Where I like you the best,
      C       E7          F
And keep the things you forgot.
```
