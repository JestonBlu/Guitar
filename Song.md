            Am                    G
Now here we go, finally got you alone,
                   F
Grab another drink I dont want to go home, its got me feeling all right,
Am                       G                        F
Caught up in the night time, hanging riverside, looking right into my eyes
                         Am                     G   
Girl you bring me to my knees, begging darlin please girl,
     F
Please dont let me go, dont let me go, let me go,
                     Am                   G
Ill push it all night, riding on the line,
                      F
Saying mine, youll be mine, youll be mine
                        Am                                G
I think I know what you need, let me take you down the street,
                F
I gotta figure how to show you, how to show you what you really mean to me
Am                  G                 F
I wanna tell you everything, but in the end, this cant end, this cant end,
                Am                           G             F
I just cant comprehend, all these feelings inside, gotta bottle by my side
                       Am             G                 F
Take a ride, I really need you, and I know you need me too, cant pretend its the end,
                Am                     G               F
Im coming after you, and I know you want me too, here we go, here we go, here we go


Now Im all up in my head, 


Am                   G                     F
Now Im all up in my head, wondering if ill ever figure out how much I mean to you,
Am                G             
And I dont know what to do, but lets pretend in the end, its just me and you

And I know you know its true, I cant bend, I wont bend, I will bend

lets pretend

Stumbling through the streets
Waiting my time
No one really knows
