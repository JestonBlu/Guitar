            Am                    G
Now here we go, finally got you alone,
                   F
Grab another drink I dont want to go home, its got me feeling all right,
Am                       G                        F
Caught up in the night time, hanging riverside, looking right into my eyes
                         Am                     G   
Girl you bring me to my knees, begging darlin please girl,
     F
Please dont let me go, dont let me go, let me go,
                     Am                   G
Ill push it all night, riding on the line,
                      F
Saying please be mine, please be mine, please be mine
                        Am                                G
I think I know what you need, let me take you down the street,
                F
I gotta figure how to show you, how to show you what you really mean to me
Am                  G                 F
I wanna tell you everything, but in the end, this cant end, this cant end,
                Am                           G             F
I just cant comprehend, all these feelings inside, gotta bottle by my side
                       Am             G                 F
Take a ride, I really need you, and I know you need me too, cant pretend its the end,
                Am                     G               F
Im coming after you, and I know you want me too, here we go, here we go, here we go
Am                    G                          F
Now Im all up in my head, lying on the bed, questioning everything I said,
Am                       G                        F
And I dont know what to do, but lets pretend in the end, its just me and you,
Am                        G                        F
And I know you know its true, I cant bend, I wont bend, I will bend
Am                    G          F
And I know you want me too.......................
                 Am                           G                        F
Im coming after you, and I'm running out of time, got your body on my mind
                Am                   G
Wanna take you down, and I dont know what to do, there so many little things

I wish I said to you, I see you staring too,

let it go, let it go, let it go, You see me staring too,

let it go, let it go, let it go, You know I want you too
