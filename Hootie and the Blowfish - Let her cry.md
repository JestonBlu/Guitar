G                      D
She sits alone by a lam-post
C                                           G
Trying to find a thought that's escaped her mind
G                               D
She says "Dad's the one I love the most."
C                   G
But Stipe's not far behind

G                       D
She never lets me in    only tells me where she's been
C                         G
when she's had to much to drink
G                                D
I say that I don't care   I just run my hands through her dark hair
C                                          G
then I pray to God, "You gotta help me fly away"   (and just)

        C              G
let her cry     if the tears fall down like rain
        C             Em    G       D
let her sing    If it eases all her pain
        C               G
let her go      let her walk right out on me
           D
and if the sun comes up tomorrow, 
        C             G
let her be,   let her be

G                            D
This morning I woke up alone    found a note standing by the phone
C                             G
saying "maybe, maybe I'll be back someday"
G
I wanted to look for you
           D
you walked in, I didn't know just what I should do
      C                                   G
So, I sat back down, had a beer and felt sorry for myself
  
       C              G
Let her cry     if the tears fall down like rain
        C             Em    G       D
let her sing    If it eases all her pain
        C               G
let her go      let her walk right out on me
           D
and if the sun comes up tomorrow, 
        C       G
let her be,  oh..

G
last night I tried to leave
D
cried so much I could not believe
C                                          G
she was the same girl I fell in love with long ago
G
she went in the back to get high
D
I sat down on my couch and cried yelling
C                       G
"Oh Mama!, please help me.  Won't you hold my hand"

        C              G
let her cry     if the tears fall down like rain
        C             Em    G       D
let her sing    If it eases all her pain
        C               G
let her go      let her walk right out on me
           D                              G
and if the sun comes up tomorrow, let her be
