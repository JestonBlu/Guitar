C  Cadd11 x4

 

C  Cadd11     C          Cadd11     G  Gadd11

           It came to me like a dream

 

       F                   C   Cadd11

The kind that always leaves

 

              C      Cadd11   G  Gadd11

just when the best part starts

 

    F             C  Cadd11

It ends so abruptly

 

               C          Cadd11 G

to leave you stunned and naked

 

       Gadd11    F

in the bedroom all alone

 

      C     Cadd11     C           Cadd11

It's kinda funny how something so soothing

 

 G     Gadd11            F

gets interrupted by the ring of a telephone

 

 

Am C  G  Em  F  G

         ...and you broke me like the cigarette

 

G      Gadd11         F

that I busted on the day I quit

 

C Cadd11               C        Cadd11

        and now that I've been drinking

 

G          Gadd11       F

I'm outta smokes and i wish that I had it

 

C Cadd11         C      Cadd11

    Oh my sweet darling happiness

 

G            Gadd11        F

  you've been away from me all along

 

 Am                            C

   It's one thing I've never said

 

                        G

"I'm truly happy in my heart and in my head."

 

   Em                 F            G

      My lonely liver suspended in liquid

  It's one thing I never did was smile,

 

           G

 missing a case, lacking a lid.

 

Em                            F         G          C Cadd11

    My heart bleeds for what you never did until now
