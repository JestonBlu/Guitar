D
So quiet
                Bm
Another wasted night
                A
The television steals the conversation
D
Exhale
                Bm
Another wasted breath
                A
Again it goes unnoticed

D               A                    Bm
Please tell me you're just feeling tired
                G                                  D
'cause if it's more than that I fear that I might break
       A            Bm
Out of touch out of time
D              A                             Bm
Please send me anything but signals that are mixed
       G                         D
'cause I can't read your rolling eyes
       A                   Bm
Out of touch are we out of time

Close lipped
Another goodnight kiss
Is robbed of all its passion
Your grip
Another time is slack
It leaves me feeling empty

Please tell me you're just feeling tired
'cause if it's more than that I fear that I might break
Out of touch out of time
Please send me anything but signals that are mixed
'cause I can't read your rolling eyes
Out of touch are we out of time

Em                G
I'll wait until tomorrow
                  D
Maybe you'll feel better then
               A              Em
Maybe we'll be better then
                  G
So what's another day
                        D                                  A       Em
When I can't bear these nights of thoughts of going on without you
                      G
This mood of yours is temporary
         D
It seems worth the wait
                  A    Em
To see you smile again
           G
Out of the corner of my eye
             D                            A
Wonâ€™t be the only way you're looking at me then

So quiet
Another wasted night
The television steals the conversation
Exhale
Another wasted breath
Again it goes unnoticed
