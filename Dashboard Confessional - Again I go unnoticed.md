D
So quiet
                Bm
Another wasted night
                A
The television steals the conversation
D
Exhale
                Bm
Another wasted breath
                A
Again it goes unnoticed

D               A                    Bm
Please tell me you're just feeling tired
                G                                  D
'cause if it's more than that I fear that I might break
       A            Bm
Out of touch out of time
D              A                             Bm
Please send me anything but signals that are mixed
       G                         D
'cause I can't read your rolling eyes
       A                   Bm
Out of touch are we out of time

D
Close lipped
                  Bm
Another goodnight kiss
                     A
Is robbed of all its passion
D
Your grip
                Bm
Another time is slack
                     A
It leaves me feeling empty

D               A                    Bm
Please tell me you're just feeling tired
                G                                  D
'cause if it's more than that I fear that I might break
       A            Bm
Out of touch out of time
D              A                             Bm
Please send me anything but signals that are mixed
       G                         D
'cause I can't read your rolling eyes
       A                   Bm
Out of touch are we out of time

Em                G
I'll wait until tomorrow
                  D
Maybe you'll feel better then
               A              Em
Maybe we'll be better then
                  G
So what's another day
                        D                                  A       Em
When I can't bear these nights of thoughts of going on without you
                      G
This mood of yours is temporary
         D
It seems worth the wait
                  A    Em
To see you smile again
           G
Out of the corner of my eye
             D                            A
Wonâ€™t be the only way you're looking at me then

D
So quiet
                Bm
Another wasted night
                A
The television steals the conversation
D
Exhale
                Bm
Another wasted breath
                A               D
Again it goes unnoticed
